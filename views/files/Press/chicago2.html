CHICAGO TRIBUNE, 20 March 2001<br>

      <p><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
 size="2"><b>To the vast majority of the American classical music
audience, M&ucirc;za Rubackyte is just a name, and one difficult to
pronounce, at that. But the Paris-based Lithuanian pianist clearly
deserves to have a big career on these shores, and its mainly Vie
strange, parochial politics of the U.S. music industry that have stood
in her way.<br>
      </b></font><b><font color="#ffffff"
 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I recently managed to
hear her in a recital broadcast live in Chicago, and nationally via
satellite, by fine-arts radio station WFMT, and was bowled over by what
I heard. Rubackyte is a marvelously gifted pianist, but her gifts do
not stop at total mastery of the keyboard. </font></b></p>
      <p><b><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
 size="2">She is also a musician of uncommon sensitivity and
intelligence, as tier program proved. Her French group, culminating in
Ravel's "Alborada del gracioso" and Messiaen's "Premiere communion de
la Vierge" (from "20 Regards sur I'Enfant Jesus"), was as refined as
could be, informed by a crystalline touch. How many artists today can
play French piano music with this degree of style? Ms. Rubackyte is one
of the favored few. And her Liszt Sonata in B minor, which closed the
program, was more than impressive technically - it was a deeply musical
experience. This sprawling, colossally demanding sonata can easily fall
apart in the wrong hands, but Ms. Rubackyt&eacute;'s, control of the
long line did not falter for an instance. Her ability to conjure power
and lyrical grace where required - often at the same time - seemed as
infinite as her tone colors- She made Liszt's demonic imagery palpable</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
 size="2">I hope to hear Ms. Rubackyte again soon, in a major local
venue, preferably in tandem with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. A
talent such as hers demands major halls and major orchestras.</font></b></p>
