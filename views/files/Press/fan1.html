Timing is everything. Nicholas Angelich has the fingers for Liszt, and
he is not without ideas. A prodigy and prizewinner, his education
includes study with several outstanding artists&#8212;Ciccolini, Loriod,
B&eacute;roff, Fleisher, Pires. His musical interests are admirably
wide. His career is blossoming. And his go at the <i>Ann&eacute;es</i>
has already met with critical acclaim in Europe, which, one hopes, will
open to him the further exposure his talents deserve. On the other
hand, with M&ucirc;za Rubackyt&eacute; (say roo-bahts-skee-<i>tay</i>),
whose traversal of the <i>Ann&eacute;es</i> followed Angelich&#8217;s by a
matter of months, we&#8217;re not talking prizes, talent, or promise but a
milestone release by one of the world&#8217;s great pianists, a compleat
artist, and a born Liszt player&#8212;comparisons are revealing. Listening to
Angelich, we think how well he plays. And the upfront, uncramped
immediacy of his aural capture wings his flair. <i>Chez</i>
Rubackyt&eacute;, we forget the piano as the sounds dissolve into a
prehension of Liszt&#8217;s spiritual world&#8212;those melancholy cypresses of the
Villa d&#8217;Este, or the ecstasy of its fountains&#8217; play, homesickness and
distant bells, the storm&#8217;s rush and the impassioned soliloquy of the
nameless narrator of Obermann&#8217;s Valley, the nympholeptic trance
engendered by a lovely face thrice rendered by the Petrarch Sonnets,
and so on. Angelich seldom touches this realm. Indeed, he never allows
you to forget how well he&#8217;s playing through pointlessly distended
accounts of <i>Chapelle de Guillaume Tell</i>, <i>Sonetto 123</i>,
the <i>Dante Sonata</i>, or the <i>Pri&egrave;re aux anges gardiens</i>,
among others, labored by generic sensitivity and gravid pauses
portending&#8230; nothing. Take the last. Though deeply felt, the <i>Pri&egrave;re</i>,
from Liszt&#8217;s old age in Rome, is not one of his stronger
pieces&#8212;Angelich knows this and feels obliged to &#8220;make something of it,&#8221;
but his sanctimonious plodding and search for deep meaning in every
phrase simply highlight its weaknesses, where Rubackyt&eacute;, without
hustle, moves things along in a projection of its overall shape as a
blithe orison rising to an impassioned climax to fade away as if
concentration had been lost, as its conclusion suggests.
Rubackyt&eacute; gives us a human document shot through with charm,
freshness, and the near-vocal gestures of prayer where Angelich
maunders through ten minutes of cluelessness. But, then, very few
pianists have divined the alternately haunted and Grace-rife world of
the <i>Troisi&egrave;me Ann&eacute;e</i> with the sure touch
Rubackyt&eacute; brings to it. And speaking of touch, it must be said
that beside her deft fluency in the most demanding passages, tonal
finesse, and glowing color, Angelich&#8217;s Big Technique seems a blunt
instrument. He&#8217;s better than that, but comparisons are apt to be
invidious. Both productions are attractively packaged, and if you can&#8217;t
get Lyrinx domestically (distribution&#8217;s been haphazard) try one of the
overseas dealers who advertise at the back of the magazine. Lyrinx has
provided Rubackyt&eacute; with state-of-the-art sound, placing her
astounding tonal palette in the porches of your ears, quite as if you
were on stage with her in Marseillais&#8217;s Salle Blachi&egrave;re. Not yet
equipped with surround sound, I can only guess what more these already
superb hybrids may reveal. Angelich cannot be denied a recommendation,
but M&ucirc;za Rubackyt&eacute;&#8217;s <i>Ann&eacute;es</i> are primary&#8212;an
unique and indispensable transport to the heart of Liszt country. </font></strong></p>
